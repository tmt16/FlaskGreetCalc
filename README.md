Flask Greet and Calc

Step Zero: Setup Your Environment
It will be more convenient if you always have an “environmental variable” that sets FLASK_ENV to “development”, so you don’t have to do that every time you open a new terminal window.

You can configure this in your ~/.bash_profile. To confirm, open up this file in VSCode:

code ~/.bash_profile
Add the following line to it, if you don’t have this line already included:

export FLASK_ENV=development
Close this terminal window and open a new one.

Test that this works like this:

$ echo $FLASK_ENV
development
Set Up Your Project
Download the starter code. You’ll get a directory with two directories in it:

flask-greet-calc/
  greet/
  calc/
At the top level of this (inside flask-greet-calc), create a virtual environment:

$ python3 -m venv venv
Start using your venv:

$ source venv/bin/activate
(env) $
Install Flask:

(env) $ pip3 install flask
...
Make a “requirements.txt” file in this directory with a listing of all the software needed for this project:

(env) $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
(you can look at that file with cat requirements.txt)

Set Up Git
We want you to add this project to Git, so let’s make our project a Git repository:

(env) $ git init
Then, since we don’t want the venv/ folder put into Git (or send to GitHub), put it in a file called .gitignore (notice the leading dot!). Inside that file should be this line:

.gitignore
venv/
(which means “ignore all folders named venv/ anywhere here and below, as far as git is concerned”)

You should test that Git is ignoring this file by making sure it doesn’t appear as an untracked file in git status:

(env) $ git status
Greet
In the greet folder, Make a simple Flask app that responds to these routes with simple text messages:

/welcome
Returns “welcome”
/welcome/home
Returns “welcome home”
/welcome/back
Return “welcome back”
Once you’ve finished this, run the tests for it:

$ python3 -m unittest test.py
Calc
Build a simple calculator with Flask, which uses URL query parameters to get the numbers to calculate with.

Make a Flask app that responds to 4 different routes. Each route does a math operation with two numbers, a and b, which will be passed in as URL GET-style query parameters.

/add
Adds a and b and returns result as the body.
/sub
Same, subtracting b from a.
/mult
Same, multiplying a and b.
/div
Same, dividing a by b.
For example, a URL like http://localhost:5000/add?a=10&b=20 should return a string response of exactly 30.

Write the routes for this but don’t hardcode the math operation in your route function directly. Instead, we’ve provided helper functions for this in the file operations.py:

calc/operations.py
"""Basic math operations."""

def add(a, b):
    """Add a and b."""
    
    return a + b

def sub(a, b):
    """Substract b from a."""

    return a - b

def mult(a, b):
    """Multiply a and b."""

    return a * b

def div(a, b):
    """Divide a by b."""

    return a / b
Import and use these in your routes.

After you’ve tried out your app, run the unit tests:

$ python3 -m unittest test.py
